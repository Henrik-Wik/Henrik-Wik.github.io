      <p class="lead">Hello, my name is Henrik Wik.
        <br>
      <p class="lead">
        I am a third-year student in the Analytical Finance program at Mälardalen University.
        It is a mathematics program with a focus on financial engineering.
        Some of my favorite courses I have taken are Portfolio Theory, Analytical Finance with
        MATLAB, and my degree project in mathematics, therefore, I am very interested in working in these areas.
        I will graduate in June 2023, so I am now looking for my first full-time job. I currently live in Bålsta but
        would be happy to move if I find a good job.
      <p class="lead">
        My program is also international, so all my courses are in English, and my fellow students often speak in
        English. I also have some knowledge in bookkeeping, invoicing, and administration, both from my education and as
        I have
        worked a bit at the alarm company Tele W with administration and documentation.
        I also spent 4-5 years on the MScEng. program in industrial economics before switching to Analytical Finance
        as I wanted to work more with financial economics.
        Therefore, I have a lot of experience in group work and presentations with many different people, and I also
        have a lot of management courses that others in my program do not have.
      <p class="lead">
        In addition to my skills, I am very thorough, analytical, structured, and constantly try to develop myself.
        For example, I do a lot of strength training in my spare time and write my own exercise programs in Excel to
        keep track of my progress.
        I spend some time organizing my schedule and am always on time when it comes to schoolwork. As a mathematician,
        I also like problem solving and learning new things.
        I enjoy group work at school, and often also try to take responsibility and make sure everything goes as it
        should.
        In my free time, I sit a lot at the computer, I have a good grasp of the stock market and like to invest myself
        when I am not playing games with friends.
